1) Given our reduced amount of time we believe we should receive 15 points. We needed the maximum 
amount of days to complete the game. Our members have also spent quite a significant amount of time outside of class 
working on the game. 

2) We were able to nearly recreate a timeless classic within one week. Our game is simple to play and 
simple in interface. The behavior of Pac-man and the ghosts are what you'd expect in the original arcade.
There is no special bold bit that allows Pac-man to eat the ghosts, and the user only has one life. 
This makes our game different from the arcade Pac-man in that it is harder to win. 

3) The game has some [minor] glitches, primarily concerning checking if pacMan has "died".

4) The game was designed with classes inherited from GridWorld code. The game board was created on the 
Gridworld grid. Pac-man extends the Bug class which eats the yellow bits which extends the Flower class. 
Rock objects of the Rock class act as borders for the game. Each individual ghost extends a universal pacGhost
class which handles similar behavior of each ghost. The pacGhost class extends the Bug class. This design 
allowed us to create the game in a timely fashion and therefore a good design. 

5) Alex - I initially wanted to develop Pac-man's behaviors in the pacMan class and the yellow Bits. However
due to AP exams and my absences I was not able to contribute as much to the project as I had initially 
wanted to. Nevertheless I was still able to test the game and fix small bugs. I think I deserve 10 points.

David - I was initially concerned about making the controls work for the game. I was originally  in charge of the
GUI, pacMan's movement, and generally making the world work. However, because of Alex's absences, I ended up
coding most of the pacMan class, including the act method, changing direction, and checking if the game was won.
In addition, I helped debug the ghost class(es) and added a retry feature. I believe that I deserve fifteen points
based on the amount of time spent on the project, including debugging and working with the repository problems.

Jesse - I programmed the ghost classes, giving each ghost a distinct personality in terms of selecting
their target location. In chase mode, Blinky targets pacMan's current location, Clyde targets pacMan's
current location when he is far away enough, Pinky targets the second tile in front of pacMan, and
Inky targets a position based on both pacMan's position and Blinky's position. In scatter mode,
the ghosts will move toward their respective corners.
